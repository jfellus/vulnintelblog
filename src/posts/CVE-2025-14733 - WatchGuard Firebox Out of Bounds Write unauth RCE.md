# CVE-2025-14733 - WatchGuard Firebox Out of Bounds Write leads to unauthenticated RCE

On December 18, 2025, a critical unauthenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability was [disclosed by WatchGuard](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-psirt/advisory/wgsa-2025-00027) in their Firebox appliances, tracked as [CVE-2025-14733](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-14733). This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Firebox devices due to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Fireware OS's `iked` process. This process is involved in IKEv2 VPN handling.

Any WatchGuard Firebox appliance exposing the IKEv2 VPN service (typically UDP 500/4500) and running Fireware OS versions prior to 12.8.2 is vulnerable. This vulnerability affects both the Mobile User VPN with IKEv2 and the Branch Office VPN using IKEv2 when configured with a dynamic gateway peer.
This vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 9.3 (Critical) due to its ease of public unauthenticated exploitation over the Internet.

## Affected Versions

* 2025.1 - Fixed in 2025.1.4
* 12.x - Fixed in 12.11.6
* 12.5.x (T15 & T35 models) - Fixed in 12.5.15
* 12.3.1 (FIPS-certified release) - Fixed in 12.3.1_Update4 (B728352)
* 11.x (11.10.2 up to and including 11.12.4_Update1) - End-of-Life

# The vulnerability

The vulnerability in CVE-2025-14733 is due to improper handling of IKEv2 packets in the `iked` process of Fireware OS. An attacker can send specially crafted IKEv2 packets to the vulnerable Firebox device, triggering an out-of-bounds write condition. While not much technical detail has been publicly disclosed about it, it is fairly easy to spot evil packets targeting this vulnerability in appliance logs:
* **Invalid peer certificate chain**: Messages like `Received peer certificate chain is longer than 8. Reject this certificate chain` indicate suspicious IKE2 Auth payloads with more than 8 certificates.
* **Abnormally large IKE_AUTH request CERT payload**: An IKE_AUTH request log message with an abnormally large CERT payload size (greater than 2000 bytes) is a strong indicator of an attack. Look for `"IKE_AUTH request" message has 6 payloads [ IDi(sz=21) CERT(sz=3000) SA(sz=44) TSi(sz=24) TSr(sz=24) N(sz=8)]` info-level logs.
* **IKE process hang**: During a successful exploit, the IKED process (responsible for handling IKE negotiations) will hang, interrupting VPN tunnel negotiations and re-keys. This is a strong indicator of attack.

# Observed exploitation

WatchGuard has reported that they have observed active exploitation of this vulnerability at least from the following IP addresses:
* [45.95.19\[.\]50](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/45.95.19.50)
* [51.15.17\[.\]89](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/51.15.17.89)
* [172.93.107\[.\]67](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/172.93.107.67)
* [199.247.7\[.\]82](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/199.247.7.82)

Interestingly, these IP addresses have also been [flagged by Arctic Wolf](https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/fortinet-fortigate-under-active-attack.html) as actively exploiting two other recently disclosed security vulnerabilities in Fortinet FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager (CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719, CVSS scores: 9.8).

According to the Shadowserver Foundation, more than 117,490 internet-exposed WatchGuard instances are vulnerable, among which 35,600 in the U.S., 13,000 in Germany, 11,300 in Italy, 9,000 in the U.K., and 5,800 in Canada.

# Reproduction lab

To reproduce the vulnerability, you can set up a WatchGuard Firebox appliance (physical or virtual) running a vulnerable version of Fireware OS (*e.g.*: [Fireware v12.11.15](https://cdn.watchguard.com/SoftwareCenter/Files/XTM/12_11_5/FireboxV_12_11_5.ova)). Configure the appliance to expose the IKEv2 VPN service (UDP ports 500 and 4500) and set up either Mobile User VPN with IKEv2 or Branch Office VPN using IKEv2 with a dynamic gateway peer.
