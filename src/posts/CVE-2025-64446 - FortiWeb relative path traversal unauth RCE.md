# CVE-2025-64446 - Critical FortiWeb relative path traversal leads to admin-level authentication bypass

On Nov 14, 2025, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability was disclosed by Fortinet regarding Fortiweb versions 7.x and 8.x. This vulnerability enables an unauthenticated attacker to interact with administrative API endpoints and execute priviledged commands on the system via crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.

The vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2025-64446](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-64446), arises from improper validation of relative paths in HTTP requests. By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can traverse directories and access sensitive administrative functions, bypassing the authentication flow. Because it allows unauthenticated access to administrative APIs and FortiWeb HTTP endpoints are often exposed to the internet, this vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 (Critical).

# The vulnerability

This auth bypass vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of relative paths in the HTTP endpoint `/cgi-bin/fwbcgi`. Weak parameter parsing logic and validation of serialized/encoded CGI metadata subsequently allows an unauthenticated attacked to gain admin privileges and execute administrative commands remotely. Albeit quite noisy, exploitation is straightforward and can be performed using simple HTTP requests from the Internet. Several [public PoCs](https://github.com/watchtowrlabs/watchTowr-vs-Fortiweb-AuthBypass/blob/main/watchTowr-vs-Fortiweb-AuthBypass.py) are available, whose weaponization is trivial.

# Affected Versions

* Fortinet FortiWeb 8.0.0 to 8.0.1
* FortiWeb 7.6.0 to 7.6.4
* FortiWeb 7.4.0 to 7.4.9
* FortiWeb 7.2.0 to 7.2.11
* FortiWeb 7.0.0 to 7.0.11

# Observed exploitation

[Pwndefend](https://www.pwndefend.com/2025/11/13/suspected-fortinet-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/) and [DefusedCyber](https://x.com/DefusedCyber/status/1975242250373517373) have reported active exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild, with multiple threat actors scanning for and exploiting vulnerable FortiWeb instances. [Fortinet's advisory](https://fortiguard.fortinet.com/psirt/FG-IR-25-910) confirm exploitation attempts have been observed since November 10, 2025.


# Mitigation

* Disable HTTP or HTTPS for internet facing interfaces.
* Immediately upgrade to FortiWeb versions 8.0.2, 7.6.5, 7.4.10, 7.2.12, 7.0.12 or higher.
